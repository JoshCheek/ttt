T(ic) T(ac) T(oe)
=================

When complete, TTT will be a Tic Tac Toe lib, as well as some sort of interface to allow for gameplay.


Iterations For the Lib
----------------------

Currently on **Iteration 1**.

### Iteration 1 - basic functionality

* Start a game
* Interface can mark the board


### Iteration 2 - Players can play the game

* As a player, view the board
* As a player, win the game
* As a player, lose the game
* As a player, tie the game


### Iteration 3 - Computer player

* Provide a computer player


### Iteration 4 - Computer plays perfectly

* Computer player cannot lose



Iterations For the Interface
----------------------------

I will think about this more later. Probably a simple CLI at first, then maybe a CLI with colour. Then perhaps a web interface or a gui.
