T(ic) T(ac) T(oe)
=================

When complete, TTT will be a Tic Tac Toe lib, as well as some sort of interface to allow for gameplay.


Iterations For the Lib
----------------------

Currently on **Iteration 4**.

### Iteration 1 - basic functionality

* Start a game
* Interface can mark the board

### Iteration 2 - Players can play the game

* As a developer and tester, view the board
* As a player, win the game
* As a player, lose the game
* As a player, tie the game

### Iteration 3 - Computer plays perfectly

* Computer player cannot lose


### Iteration 4 - Real CLI

* binary named ttt
* accepts --interface cli
* asks if you want to go first (x) or second (o)
* plays game vs you



Iterations For the Interface
----------------------------

Maybe a CLI with colour. Then perhaps a web interface or a gui.



Possible Future Features
------------------------

* Strict mode, which raises errors for common types of invalid behaviour
